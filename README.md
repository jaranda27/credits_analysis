# credits analysis

In my latest project, I delved into the intricate realm of credit assignment analytics, employing a comprehensive approach to distill crucial insights for optimal decision-making. By scrutinizing variables such as income, expenditure patterns, and debt capacity, I conducted an exhaustive exploratory analysis and rigorous hypothesis testing. The focal point of the study was to discern significant distinctions in income across diverse demographics, notably gender, educational backgrounds, and socio-economic strata. To fortify the predictive prowess of the project, I meticulously crafted and fine-tuned a regression model. This model, a testament to precision and efficacy, serves as a robust tool for forecasting the precise amount of loan suitable for an individual customer, offering a data-driven beacon for strategic lending decisions. This endeavor showcases not only my adeptness in exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing but also my proficiency in constructing predictive models to empower informed and judicious credit assignment practices.
